# OctaPi: Public Key Cryptography

In this resource you will learn about the concepts behind public key cryptography including the concepts of a **public key** and a **private key**. This resource gives you the background behind public key cryptography, including questions to test your understanding and a Python programming challenge. You will then use the OctaPi to find prime factors with a brute force method.

## The story of Public Key Encryption

In 1976, American mathematicians, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, published a method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys in public. For many years this was the story of public key cryptography. However, in 1997 GCHQ declassified and published work done in the early 1970s by British mathematicians working for them that showed that the key concepts of public key cryptography had been originally discovered in the UK. Up to that point it had all been kept secret by the UK government.

The GCHQ mathematician, James Ellis, first came up with the idea is two papers: [The Possibility of Secure Non-secret Digital Encryption](https://www.gchq.gov.uk/sites/default/files/document_files/CESG_Research_Report_No_3006_0.pdf) (January 1970) and [The Possibility of Secure Non-secret Analogue Encryption](https://www.gchq.gov.uk/sites/default/files/document_files/CESG_Research_Report_No_3007_0.pdf) (May 1970).

In 1974, another GCHQ mathematician, Clifford Cocks, described a possible implementation of the "non-secret encryption" technique using prime numbers in his paper [Note on "Non-secret Encryption"](https://www.gchq.gov.uk/sites/default/files/document_files/Cliff%20Cocks%20paper%2019731120.pdf).

Finally, the GCHQ mathematician, Malcolm Williamson, described a method of key exchange in January 1974 in his paper [Non-secret Encryption using a Finite Field"](https://www.gchq.gov.uk/sites/default/files/document_files/nonsecret_encryption_finite_field_0.pdf). This is very similar the the Diffie-Hellman technique of key exchange but predates it by several years.

If you are interested in knowing more about the topic, have a look at _Applied Cryptography - Protocols, Algorithms, and Source Code in C_, Bruce Schneier, Wiley, ISBN 978-1-119-09672-6. Note that the story of public key cryptography in this book pre-dates the GCHQ announcement in 1997.
