## Programming challenge

1. Write a Python program that takes the number 28 and prints out all of its factors. (Solution [here](resources/brute_force_factor.py) - no peeking! )

1. Alter your program so that it takes any number the user types in and outputs all of its factors. (Solution [here](resources/brute_force_factor2.py) )

1. Experiment (with trial and error) to find the largest number can you type in to your program before it takes a very long time or crashes?

1. Add a timer to benchmark how long your code takes to return the answer. Here is some [timer code](resources/timer_code.py), to time how long a loop takes to execute. Can you adapt this code to time how long your script takes to find the factors of a given number?

1. Run your code and time how long it takes to find the factors of 3, 5 and 7 digit numbers.
