# How are public and private keys chosen?

Using public key cryptography is like signing a message with your own __digital signature__. Not only does it prevent unauthorised people from reading your message, it proves that the message originates from the person who claims to have sent it.

The **public key** can be any number which meets the following criteria:

- It is chosen using a random source of information so that it is unpredictable.
- It is the product of two numbers, A * B = AB, and A and B are both **prime** numbers (each only divisible by itself and 1).
- This product AB is a large number and therefore has many digits.
- A and B are used as private keys and are the only **factors** of the public key AB.

We can see how this works in practice as follows:

Suppose we ignore the requirement for the **public key** to be a large number for now and use small randomly chosen **prime** numbers, A=2 and B=5. This makes the **public key** AB = 2 * 5 = 10. It is easy to work out that A=2 and B=5 are the only possible **factors** of 10.

If we use A=2 and B=5 as the **private keys**, AB = 10 becomes the **public key**. Let's assume Alice uses A=2 as her **private key** and Bob uses B=5 as his.

Now imagine an attacker intercepts the message sent from Bob to Alice. The attacker can find out that the **public key** was 10 because it will need to be sent along with the encrypted message, and the attacker may even know that the **private keys** are the **factors** of the **public key**.

So from the attacker's point of view, to break the cryptography they will need to find A and B by finding the factors of the **public key**, AB = 10:

```
10 = A * B
```

Because we have chosen small value **private keys**, A=2 and B=5, in this example, it is very easy for the attacker to figure out what these **private keys** are. All they have to do is multiply all possible values of `A` and `B` and see which multiplication results in the value 10. In this example, the attacker could probably even do it in their head!

However, if the **public key** were a larger number, it would be considerably more difficult to work out the **factors**. Essentially, this is what protects the message: a hard maths problem.

How easy would it be to find the two **factors** using a computer program?

## Finding factors

Remember that one of the criteria for a suitable public key is that it must be a number which is the product of two **prime** numbers. To put it another way, a public key has to be a number with only two **factors**, meaning dividing the number by any number besides the two factors will leave a remainder.

Try to divide 12 by all the numbers between 2 and 11, and write down which ones it is divisible by.

No. The number 12 can be **factorised** as 12 = 2 * 6 and 12 = 3 * 4.

**Can you generalise your strategy for finding factors, so that if you were given the number `n` and asked to find out its factors, you could describe to someone how to do it?**

You may generalise your previous rule as "Try to divide n by all the numbers between 2 and n-1, and write down which ones it is divisible by." In actual fact, you don't need to test up to n-1, you can stop at âˆšn. Why not try [this activity](https://nrich.maths.org/7520) to learn about the Sieve of Eratosthenes to see why!
